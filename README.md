# DeepFlowState: Demo Repository for *Understanding Deep Learning*

Welcome to the demo repository for the Osnabrück University course *Understanding Deep Learning*, part of the Cognitive Science program.

This repository showcases a practical application of deep learning using **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), originally introduced by Devlin et al. (2019). It is maintained by the **DeepFlowState** group and is designed to demonstrate our approach to model fine-tuning and transfer learning in the context of pharmacovigilance.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to **detect Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)** in text using a fine-tuned BERT model. ADR detection is a key part of pharmacovigilance—the ongoing monitoring of drug safety in real-world usage. It is important to detect adverse reactions to medicine as early as possible. Tools that can be used for this early detection are NLP methods applied on posts on social media and medical feedback forums.

We fine-tune and test the pre-trained BERT model on the following labeled datasets:

- **ADE Corpus**: Data from general Medical Case Reports (general medicine)
- **IMI WEB-RADR**: Data from Twitter posts (general medicine)
- **PsyTAR**: Data from medical feedback forums (specific to psychiatry)
- **CADEC**: Data from medical feedback forums (general medicine)

Each of these datasets includes labeled examples of drug-related adverse reactions.

## 🔬 Novelty & Research Focus: Transfer Learning & Generalization

Our project explores the generalization capability of BERT through **cross-dataset transfer learning**. This constitutes the novelty of our approach that we go beyond 'in-domain' training & testing and we train 'in-domain' and test 'out-of-domain' Here's what we investigate:

- Can a BERT model fine-tuned on one dataset effectively detect ADRs in entirely different datasets? (E.g. from a general medicine dataset like ADE Corpus to a specific psychiatry dataset like PsyTAR)
- How well does it transfer across **platforms, annotation guidelines, and drug vocabularies**?

We compare performance across:

- A **training dataset** from one dataset (ADE Corpus) used for training (in-domain)
- And **an external test dataset** (PsyTAR) (out-of-domain)

This allows us to evaluate how well the model captures the *underlying concept* of ADR, independent of dataset-specific biases. We plan to train and test with all datasets crosswise.
